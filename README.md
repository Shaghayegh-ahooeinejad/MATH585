# MATH585
GitHub Skill Task

Here is the the description of the assignment that is needed to be done in order to gain the credit for it:



1. Go to https://github.com and create an account if you do not already have one. A free account is fine.
2. Create a new repository, and add something to it.
3. Create two branches on your project, and modify it significantly in each.
4. Merge your two branches back to a single project.
5. Make your repository public, and email Jane a link to it. Or, if possible, add Jane as a collaborator.


This is the first branch that is built and we are modifying what is inside of it.
